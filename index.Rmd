# Welcome to My R Markdown Site!

This is the home page of my minimally working website built with `rmarkdown::render_site()`.

## About This Site

This site demonstrates how to create a multi-page website using R Markdown. You can navigate between pages using the links in the top navigation bar.

### R Code Output Example

Here's a simple R code chunk that outputs some text:

```{r echo=TRUE}
message("Hello from R Markdown!")
x <- 1:5
y <- x^2
print(data.frame(x, y))
```
