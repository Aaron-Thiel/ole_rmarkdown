# About This Project

This project is a simple demonstration of building a website with R Markdown.

## A Simple Plot

Here's an example of a plot generated directly within an R Markdown page:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
plotly::ggplotly(ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) + geom_point())
```
